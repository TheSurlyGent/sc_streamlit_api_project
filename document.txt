Introducing a web app for Star Citizen enthusiasts that provides a comprehensive view of our organization's members and their ships.
The app includes interactive widgets such as graphs, tables, and more to explore.

Usability goals were set to create a user-friendly, easy-to-navigate platform that caters to both experienced and novice players. 
The design process began with sketching out ideas and layouts, followed by implementing the design using Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly.

API integration was critical in retrieving data on the game's ships and members.
The Star Citizen API was utilized to retrieve data, which was then parsed and displayed in various forms throughout the app.
The integration process was relatively straightforward, with some challenges encountered when retrieving data that was empty,
and with Streamlit re-running.

Interactive widgets were incorporated to provide a more engaging experience for users.
These widgets were simple and intuitive, allowing users to explore the data through graphs and tables.

The app tries to adhere to various HCI design principles to ensure simplicity, consistency, and user feedback. 
Usability testing was conducted, and feedback from users was incorporated into the design.

In conclusion, the web app provides a user-friendly, engaging, and informative platform for Star Citizen enthusiasts, with potential to become an essential tool for the community.
